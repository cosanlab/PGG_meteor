	In this game you will be making a series of decisions about how to allocate points with <b>{{otherPlayers}} other players in real-time</b> over the course of {{numRounds}} rounds. Each player will be given their own private account and a separate group account will be shared by all players. At the end of the game we will randomly select one of the rounds and pay you a bonus based on the number of points earned in that round at the rate of: <b>1 point = 2 cents</b>.

	<blockquote class = "instr">
	In the beginning of every round of you will decide <b>how many of your own points you would like to contribute to the group account.</b> At the end of every round, the group account will be multiplied by 1.5 and points will be evenly redistributed to all players.
