### Public Goods Game

This is a paradigm in which users from Amazon's mechanical turk are matched in groups of arbitrary size to play a modified PGG. Several different experimental conditions exist.

This paradigm is built using [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/) a Javascript framework with fast easy-to-use client-server communication enabling effective realtime applications. This enables multi-user experimental design, aka real-time interactions over the internet.

This paradigm uses the excellent [TurkServer](https://github.com/HarvardEconCS/turkserver-meteor) for handling all Mturk requests (e.g. HIT creation, Assignment handling, Worker Payment, etc).

More details to follow.
